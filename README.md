## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install & Launch**  
   Clone the repo or grab Telepathy from your favorite store and fire it up on your device—mobile or desktop.

2. **Add Your OpenAI Key**  
   Under **Settings**, paste your OpenAI API key. This unlocks Telepathy’s AI superpowers: smart task suggestions, context‑aware prioritization, and that legendary “voice‐analysis” mode.

3. **Connect Your Calendar**  
   Link Google, Outlook, or iCloud calendars so Telepathy can see your schedule. It will optimize your tasks around meetings, deadlines, and travel time.

4. **Enable Location & Notifications**  
   Allow location access to trigger reminders at the right place—home, office, or cosmic café. Enable notifications so you never lose track of a mission-critical chore.

5. **Activate “Telepathy Mode”**  
   Hit the **Telepathy** toggle to awaken AI‑powered organization. Watch as your plain to‑do list transforms into an optimized daily plan—sorted by context, priority, and your own habits.

## 🛰️ Architecture Overview

```
/Pages            → UI in XAML & C#  
/PageModels       → ViewModels with RelayCommands  
/Services         → OpenAI, calendar, location, and audio services  
/Resources/Styles → Centralized Colors.xaml, Styles.xaml, AppStyles.xaml  
/Data             → Repositories & seed data  
/Utilities        → Helpers & converters  
```

We follow best practices:
- Use `<Border>` and `<Grid>` for modern layouts  
- Leverage `RelayCommand` for async commands in XAML  
- Keep styling in merged resource dictionaries
